    <p>The paper in Maggie’s hands said AIDS and her feet struck ground that wobbled like a rope bridge. Full-blown AIDS. Dirty spike sick trick who knows. She shuffled out of the bleachy backwash of hospital light to burrow into the cozy asshole of the late PMs. Did she feel different? Other than the knot of dope sickness that’s always stowed away in her gut that is? Maybe the skin was a little tender maybe the eye had a little tingle in it. The face reflected on the dildo shop window was constellated with scabs; anybody’s guess which was from the junk and which was from the bug. Her greasy goodwill sweater’s neckline hung down low to her shoulder like a dying slug trying to bring her down with it. Settle down she thought won’t be a minute.</p>

    <p>Sat at the bus stop she adjusted her pink latex miniskirt and fetched the doodad from her purse. Looked like a box thing with two buttons and a few dials on it. The trick gave it to her was some guy that worked at a lab downstate cooked to the gills on oxy. “What’s that?” She’d said when he handed it to her.</p>
    <p>“Worth a blowjob and a hit is what it is.”</p>
    <p>“Cash only.”</p>
    <p>“No no you don’t fucking understand this shit’s the real deal look.”</p>
    <p>He’d pressed a button and the motel room shimmied and she saw ghosts around them. It was her and the trick but faint and wavy like a broken phone screen. <span class="colored-text" data-block="block1" data-index="0" onclick="toggleText(this)" style="color: red;">She saw her ghost self put a pill on her ghost tongue walk to the ghost trick and stick it in his mouth. She saw the ghost trick swallow it and pass out. Her ghost self then rummaged through the ghost trick’s coat pocket grabbed his wallet and bailed.</span></p>

    <p>The trick pressed another button and the ghosts vanished.</p>
    <p>“Fuck was that? Did you give me something?” she said.</p>
    <p>“This is what I’m fucking trying to tell you. This shit shows you alternate realities. You set the date and place with these here dials you see what coulda gone different at that moment. And you press this other button here you up and take the place of the other you. Could be you could be a fucking lawyer or something. You get me now? You can only step into a different reality once though. Can’t bring the device with you.” He said “Now can I get my dick sucked?”</p>
    <p>She took the doodad and gave him some Ox and mediocre head. He asked her to kick him in the nads a couple times too and she threw that in for free.</p>
    
    <p>***</p>
    
    <p>The bus dropped her off near T-Rash’s trailer park. She went to his double-wide and asked him for a few days’ worth. “What you want that much for baby?” he said letting her in.</p>
    <p>“Got the bug. Might off myself.”</p>
    <p>“Say what?” He said.</p>
    <p>For once there was no one else around. Seems every time she rocked up to T-Rash’s you’d have to hop over five junkies to get to the kitchen. She didn’t see any vomit or piss neither. Far as trap houses go that qualified as clean.</p>
    <p>“I said I got the AIDS. Full-blown and I don’t know if I wanna deal with that shit.”</p>
    <p>“Fuck… well… guess it’s worse ways to go. Just go do it somewhere else I don’t want no heat” he said and handed her the bundle.</p>
    <p>“See ya around Terrence” she said and left.</p>
    
    <p>***</p>
    
    <p>The bandstand at the park seemed as good a place as any to kick it. When she was little scarfing on memorial day hot dogs she’d watch her sister Haley playing the dulcimer with her redneck band here. Streamers popcorn carts some kids would go up and dance.</p>
    <p>Will the circle<br>
    be unbroken?<br>
    By and by Lord by and by…<br>
    There’s a better<br>
    home awaiting<br>
    in the sky Lord in the Sky.</p>
    
    <p>She sat on the floor against one of the railings and dug into her purse for her spike. She felt the doodad instead and pulled it out. Alternate realities huh.</p>
    <p>She turned the dials to fourteen years ago and googled the coordinates to her childhood home on her phone and entered those as well. The surroundings started to shimmy again and the ghosts flicked into view this time dozens of them. Dad’s Superbowl barbeque in the backyard. Her sister Haley had been out of town so she just sat by herself next to the salad table while everyone gathered by the grill and the kegs. She saw Owen Dad’s boss from the auto-repair shop giving her brother a nut tap and lumbering over. He pulled a bill from his padded vest and said “how’d ya like to make a twenty?”</p>
    <p>“What for?” her ghost self said looking up. He was wide and tapered up to the top like a dirt mound stacked to six foot three.</p>
    <p>“Whaddayasay we go in the tool shed and I show ya what for?”</p>
    <p><span class="colored-text" data-block="block2" data-index="0" onclick="toggleText(this)" style="color: red;">“Fuck off” she said.</p>
    <p>“Don’t be like that now how about fifty?”</p>
    <p>“Eat shit I’m fourteen.”</p>
    <p>“Stuck-up bitch” he said and left trailing booze stink behind him.</span></p>
   
    <p>She pressed the off button and the ghosts went away.</p>
    
    <p>She turned the dials to five years after that in Owen’s office. She sees her shriveled nineteen-going-on-forty-five body standing by the door fidgeting as Owen sat at his desk.</p>
    <p>“You know yer gonna need to turn a lot more if yer fixin’ to buy a gram a day. Why don’t I switch you to the white stuff?” Owen said.</p>
    <p>“I ain’t fuck with no needles” Maggie said.</p>
    <p>He turned to her “like you ain’t taken your fair share of pricks hur hur. Come on I got my spike right here I’ll boot ya up.”</p>
    <p><span class="colored-text" data-block="block3" data-index="0" onclick="toggleText(this)" style="color: red;">“Just give me the black tar” she said.
        <p>“Fine suit yerself” he said swiveling around and opening the bottom drawer.</span></p>


    <p>Maggie kept pressing the button hoping to get to a reality where she never went to Owen’s office in the first place but gave up after a while. She fed the doodad the coordinates to her sister’s apartment four years ago. She saw Haley sitting at the kitchen table hands locked on the tabletop as though in prayer across from her ghost self who sat facing away.</p>
    <p>“I’m sorry Maggie I’m just… I’m sorry…” Haley said.</p>
    <p>“I know…” Maggie said</p>
    <p>“It’s just… I can’t… I can’t anymore…”</p>
    <p>“I know…”</p>
    <p>“… And I’m pregnant now…”</p>
    <p>Maggie started crying “I know… I would like to meet him though” Maggie said. Her sister started crying too. She reached for Maggie’s hand.</p>
    <p>“Just take rehab and you can stay how hard is that?” Haley said.</p>
    <p><span class="colored-text" data-block="block4" data-index="0" onclick="toggleText(this)" style="color: red;">“I can’t, Haley… I’ve tried…”
        <p>“Try again… You’re not a junkie, Maggie, you know that…”</p>
        <p>“Just give me a few months… I’ll find somewhere else to stay, I just need a few months…”</p>
        <p>“You’ve said that before”<br>“Just a few months, so I can get my shit in order.”</p>
        <p>“No, Maggie… I’m either driving you to the rehab center right now or you’re on your own.”</p>
        <p>Maggie looked her sister in the eye, “Haley, you’re being mean.”</p>
        <p>Haley wiped her tears, looked away. “I’m sorry Maggie… You should pack up, now.”</span></p>

    <p>Maggie pushed the off button and put the doodad down. She grabbed her kit from her purse, cooked everything she had, and loaded the spike. Four grams or more in there could take out someone that was already dead. She squeezed the plunger and saw the stream draw a trail between her legs leading to the entrance to the bandstand. She strapped her arm up and licked the needle. A car drove by blaring Bill Withers’ “Lovely Day” and she didn’t find it funny.</p>

    <p><i>Then I look at you</p>
    <p>And the world’s alright with me…</i></p>

    <p>She closed her eyes and sighed. Can’t hurt to take one more look. She put the spike between her teeth, grabbed the doodad and set the date and time to here now. She saw her ghost self <span class="colored-text" data-block="block5" data-index="0" onclick="toggleText(this)" style="color: red;">shooting up her arm, closing her eyes, and dying, thick spit trickling down her hung head.</span></p>
    <p>As the sun started to rise and wash away the fog, she noticed the ghosts started growing fainter. The lights on the doodad started to flutter. It was running out of juice. She kept flicking through but it was all the same thing: the same corpse lying in shit and piss jumping from place to place in the bandstand.</p>

    <p>Then she pressed the button and saw nothing. She looked around, no corpse. Was there something climbing the steps to the bandstand? She squinted. Sure enough, there it was: a fuzzy thing she had to go up to it to see it clearly. It was another ghost self but difficult to recognize. This one was wearing clean jeans and a tank top and her skin, though a little blistered and scabbed, looked a little plumper like it was actually covering a living thing. The ghost folded her arms on the railing of the bandstand and watched the magenta sunrise splash over the park. She then took a medicine bottle from her pocket. Maggie could barely read the label but eventually she saw it said “Retrovir.” The ghost swallowed a tablet from it. She looked tired but peaceful. Maggie’d seen many sunrises from long nights out but couldn’t remember looking at one that way before. Like it wasn’t a burden.</p>

    <p>Maggie looked at the device. The lights were barely flashing now. The ghost was blending into the air. If she pressed the other button she would take the ghost’s place in that reality. But then again she and this other Maggie were still standing here. Whatever was in that other one that allowed her to pick life over death was also inside herself.</p>

    <p>Maggie turned away from the ghost, spat out the syringe and stepped on it. She put the doodad on the railing and climbed out of the bandstand. The tint of magenta was now turning amber like a honey jar. The grass in the park was dewy like hair after a shower. She heard the first buses, cars and birds. The city was yawning.</p>

    <p>The bug might kill me she thought but it won’t beat me.</p>
